# Quantum-Secured-API-Key-Generator
This project uses a Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG) with Qiskit to create highly secure API keys and session tokens. By measuring a qubit in superposition, it generates truly unpredictable random bits, replacing standard, deterministic pseudo-random generators (PRNGs) which can be an attack vector.
